    <h2> How It Works</h2>
    <p> BidUp was created by customers, for customers, and aims to
      provide users with a simple vehicle auction system that protects
      both buyers and sellers, without any of the paywalls found at
      other sites. New users can view some of our featured auctions on
      the home page, or create an account to view and bid on our ever-expanding library
      of live auctions! </p>

    <h2> Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p><strong>Can I edit my listing once it goes live?</strong><br>
      We do not support the modification of listings at this time. Being able to change
      listing information raises many possible issues so for the interest of our users, we do not plan on adding
      this feature in the foreseeable future. If for some reason you require a change to made to a listing, including
      removing it from BidUp, feel free to reach out to our customer service department at
      customerServices@BidUp.com</p>
    <p><strong>Can I cancel my bid once it is placed?</strong><br>
      In an effort to protect the interest of the seller, we do not allow users to cancel bids once they
      have been placed. If an accident or mistake has occurred, and you wish to withdraw a bid, please contact our
      customer support team at the following email, and we will be happy to assist you: customerServices@BidUp.com</p>
    <p><strong>What happens if I win an auction, but the reserve price is not met?</strong><br>
      We work with sellers to place reasonable reserves on auction items, but sometimes, these are not met. In the
      event that this occurs, the seller will be placed in contact with the auction winner, where both parties can
      then discuss further details relating to the sale of the vehicle in question. Many times, a compromise can be
      found, where the buyer will lower the reserve, in exchange for a slightly higher final price. </p>
    <p><strong>Do you offer shipping services?</strong><br>
      We do not offer shipping services for any vehicles at this time. Unless otherwise stated by the seller, the
      buyer is responsible for arranging local pickup or delivery of the vehicle should they so choose. </p>
    <p><strong>Got a different question?</strong><br>
      For more help with other issues, or for further clarification on the way we work, feel free to get in touch with
      us at customerServices@BidUp.com</p>
